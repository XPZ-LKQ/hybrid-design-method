# hybrid-design-method

:loudspeaker: Introduction
=====
Based on the open-source software OpenSees and Python, a hybrid design method for optimizing the progressive collapse resistance of RC frame structures was proposed. Firstly, random reinforcement information of frame beams connected to the removed columns was generated by Monte Carlo method, and RC frame models corresponding to different reinforcement information were established in OpenSees to calculate the progressive collapse response. Then, the reinforcement feature maps were drawn and the data set was generated in Python. Finally, the predictive model was established based on deep learning, and the optimization design for progressive collapse of the RC frame was implemented by combining the particle swarm optimization algorithm.
